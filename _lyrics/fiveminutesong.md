title: Five Minute Song

Like a shipwreck in a prairie, she paints her idols blue  
Don't look back just now, 'cause she's coming through  
No one told me out loud, just what she'd do to you  
Like a shipwreck in a prairie, she paints her idols blue  

She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  
She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  

Clouds swing low on the, South Dakota plains  
We smoked a joint in, Ladybird Grove today  
I headed East to the, land of the Day  
Clouds swing low on the, South Dakota plains  

She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  
She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  

Take me to your, place of Be  
And let me know when we, get there safely  
The grass grows over all, that refuses to move  
Take me to your, place of Be  

She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  
She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  

She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  
She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  
She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you  
She paints her idols blue, when she comes for you
