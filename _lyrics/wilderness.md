## Wilderness

You might ask yourself while sitting  
Alone in that quiet house  
Until the world just stops it's spinning  
And turning 'round on an empty shelf  
But the words have been coming forth  
Arguing so they've lost their voice  
And not a goddamn thing can be done  

The greats stole what's meaningless  
From the singing birds and cicada nests  
But it's just behavior calling out  
It'll never be what we think it was  
So I'm cleaning ink from my fingertips  
And I'm trying to be clear with this  
And I'm sticking my head out of  
A hole in the wilderness  

You know a person is what I think of them  
A whole white world of projections  
And I feel sorry for all my friends  
Who don't know quite what I've done to them  
And so everything belongs to me  
And I'll god damned if you think you'll see  
A day when I give back to the people  
I created when I stopped to think of them  

Excuses, they are made  
And they are tailor-fit for some audience  
But if sickness should be praised  
I shouldn't say what I think of them  
But I'm afraid I must admit  
Sometimes I miss the wilderness  
And I'm sticking my head back in  
If just to see why I, well I left it  

And I remember when we would walk  
Through the streets with our only friends  
With the cars just scattering by  
And the rocks we gripped in our coat pockets  
But the police, they stole our time  
And asked us to explain ourselves  
But we wouldn’t say a word, no, you had nothing  
To offer us
