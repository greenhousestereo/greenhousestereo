title: Return Song

She said I came from nowhere  
And that nowhere was close to home  
So I found a house with red ceilings  
And dark green furniture  
Where smoke, it rose from cinders  
In lavish incense holds  
Where I hoped I had a soul  

She said I don’t want to lose you  
When it starts to snow  
And that true monsters are waiting  
For the winter months  
But the season, it will follow me  
It has no place to go  
I can feel it in my bones  

The Hills have stayed indifferent  
And I freely come and go  
But each time the day is shorter  
The blue water stops its pour  
And builds up in a barrier  
And refuses to move much more  
But maybe with enough force  

I guess I have no interest  
In empty Honeyed Hotels  
Where the walls have yellowed with the sun  
And the world spins on a shelf  
And the ravaged dogs, with their orange eyes  
Nothing left to tell  
My friends know this all too well  

So I hope to find that bleeding house  
In the valley where it sits  
Because I know that there is comfort there  
Although it has its risks  
And the water will be free once more  
When the Hills release their grip  
And all that I leave behind is this
