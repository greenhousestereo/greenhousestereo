## Pretty Eyes
What once was blue  
Let’s paint it red  
Yeah, paint it red  
That’s what we’ll do  

Take something old  
And start anew  
Yeah, start anew  
In these hills of gold  

I’m wasting time  
Reading new scrolls  
It might get cold  
Before too long  

Pretty eyes, don’t cry  
Pretty eyes, don’t cry  

So here I sit  
A tranquil night  
A glass of wine  
Some soft music  

And through my head  
Melodies roll  
They ebb and flow  

Pretty eyes, don’t cry  
Pretty eyes, don’t cry  

Life is a one-way road  
This sky’s a sanguine hue  
Life is a one-way road
