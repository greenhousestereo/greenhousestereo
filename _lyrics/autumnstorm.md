## Autumn Storm
Waiting, wanting something more  
What will you use me for  
So long then…  
Sitting with my eight new friends  
At this computer desk  
Belong here  
The autumn storm that tore these trees apart  
It left no snow, just branches in the yard  
Stuck for days  
Can’t complain  

I am much too deep in debt  
To do what I do  
Thank you to my humble school,  
For years I thought I knew the future  

The autumn storm that tore these trees apart  
It left no snow, just branches in the yard  
Stuck for days  
Can’t complain  

The autumn storm that tore these trees apart  
It left no snow, just branches in the yard  
Stuck for days  
Can’t complain  
The autumn storm that tore these trees apart  
It left no snow, just branches in the yard  
Stuck for days  
Can’t complain
