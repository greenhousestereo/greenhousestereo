When our temples come to life, we'll stop to watch the poor man die  
Frozen, stubborn, endless time has torn away the preacher's mind  
Pass on through your salts and gains--alive and well though thoughts displaced  
Never wonder for whom the bell rings. Wonder why it never rains  

I'll meet my friends at the edge of the earth, each man fed to obey the order  
We'll wait there till the world's a desert. Hold my, hand fall over the edge now  
Peace won't come, no peace won't last. Leaders too willing, will lead us so helpless  
And even though none of us ever knew our mothers, in the end, we all cry for them  

Tonight we face the blood in the sand. Our lives never rested in our hands  
They should find it no surprise that we're just fucking sick to die  
And my clover's peace will never be found, 'cause the hardest part of life is making a sound  
In this desolate existence, no one's ever gonna listen
