## Face From a Dream
Get ‘em off the phone, do what you were and were not told  
And always pretend someone is listening  
If you’re here to make us better, I wish you’d cut the propaganda  
And recognize the shit you’re spewing, Oh well  

Whole worlds of perfume  
Starlit paths  
Face from a dream  
Across the hall  
New Year’s Eve  
Timeless indeed  

Who knew what such a lovely night was lying up ahead  
And post-slumber can’t help but wonder if we’ll ever meet again  
I’m liking my odds right now, but it’s hard to see  
Maybe first I’ll get to the end of the week  

Whole worlds of perfume  
Starlit paths  
Face from a dream  
Across the hall  
New Year’s Eve  
Timeless indeed  

The night is calm  
The stars are out  
Free tables abound  
I’m waiting for you to put back the rest of that glass  
Get going to the next party my friend  
My friend
