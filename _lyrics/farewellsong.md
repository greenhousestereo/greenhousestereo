title: Farewell Song
---

The time has come to choose a new sun  
Sit beneath it, and whisper  
We're hanging up blankets on the walls  
You still stand by the window  
And I know I can do nothing at all about the way that you see me  
But I can't stop having these medication dreams so next time  
Please leave me to sleep  

Your world got trapped inside a dandelion seed  
The way it drifts from here to there  
And I know I can do nothing at all to stop it on its way  
Something is ringing clear  
So pick your head up off of my lap, it's time to leave  
I found a new way to set you free  
Because sometimes life is impossible to orchestrate  
Sometimes you've just gotta flee  

Yeah sometimes life is impossible to orchestrate  
Sometimes you've just gotta flee
