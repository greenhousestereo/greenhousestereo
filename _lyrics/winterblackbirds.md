title: Winter Blackbirds
---

Winter came on the wings of a blackbird  
The weather sings, the weather rolls on  
Water streams from these hills, freeze fast, hard  
Unlucky things, well, you just can’t swim too far  
Diamond dreams, gonna spend quite a lot more  
Gonna watch all my blackbirds float on  
And I’ve done things that I’m not so proud for  

The sun draws a line that I think I could follow  
I’ll tie my shoes up tight and let me mind wander  
A lack of sleep has made me feel somber  
And at this rate, I think I’ll be back tomorrow ‘cause  
I wanna know that nothing has come or went  
That nothing can change, and nothing can be permanent  
A half moon birth has made me feel just a little bit impotent
