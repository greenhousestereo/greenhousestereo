Bluebird black on a rusted fence  
Do you believe what's happening  
I've not slept in five long years  
Just what have you been doing  

Weekly love  
Weekend love  
Weakened love, I've found you  

When the world found me I hit it running  
But now I must say it's getting hard  
To keep my feet off of the ground  
Takes the whole world's army just to hold me down  

Weekly love  
Weekend love  
Weakened love, I've found you
