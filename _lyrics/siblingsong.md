So eight hours later  
Finished feeding the fiends  
I find my favorite human being  
Sister should we fix ourselves a drink  
And don’t stop talking  

Cause I know your mind’s still barking  
Just give it all to me  
Anything if it helps you get to sleep  
I guess you never know  
But sis it’s not your fault  
You’re magic, you’re a magnet  
Drawing other people close  
Hope you know that you’re fantastic  
You don’t need nobody else  
And through these trying times  
I hope you realize  
It’s better on the other side  

Two people on this planet  
Every road and all this taffy  
Was made for you and me  
Breathe before you sail another sea  
We’re terrible with time  
But I really don’t mind  
If it’s a little too late to leave  
Everything will be fine  
Don’t you think?  

I’m happy with our box  
There are other vacant lots  
We will win this  
Beat the sickness  
Though we know not what that means  
Be patient  
Just wait and  
You’ll find her  
You told me
