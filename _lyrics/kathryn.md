Her mother says she's been hearing ghosts  
Staying out so late in an old dust house  
But I've never wondered whether she's wrong or right  

And her spirit rests in holy Cigarettes  
Where will she spend her last long dollar next  
A man once said it, and it was better then. But we work with what we're left  

And can you see, what will be, in the years to come  
And can you see, what will be, in the years to come  

We live and we die by the time we write  
In a city too small to be impolite  
But with your back on its walls, you'll really start to wonder  

So they ask me what will happen next  
Now that the world's on track and I'm planning it  
So I look at my hands and I ask, can I show you  

And can you see, what will be, in the years to come  
And can you see, what will be, in the years to come  

Alternative lives, placed up in the sky  
Where they'll sit and where they wait  
For a moment to bring another breath and they'll sing out a warning  

Now the cold comes through me  
And it changes and it cleans, until I know just what you are  
The sky is glowing dark, and there's music in the spark  
It's all turning on you  

And can you see, what will be, in the years to come  
And can you see, what will be, in the years to come  
And can you see, what will be, in the years to come  
And can you see, what will be, in the years to come
