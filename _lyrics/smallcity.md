## Small City
Small city, brightest lights  
Someone help me waste my time  
Lovely Laura tries  
Small city, snowless heat  
There’s powder in my dreams  
So let me sleep  

It’s the same  
As yesterday  

Small city without jobs  
What color is our rug  
We’ll have enough  
Small city, smaller screen  
All these memories mean nothing  
So let me think  

It’s the same  
As yesterday  
It’s the same  
As yesterday  

La, la, la, la
