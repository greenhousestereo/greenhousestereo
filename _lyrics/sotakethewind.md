## So Take The Wind
So take the wind, rise and begin, follow it over  
In the Black Hills, the winter will, try to own you  
But I promise that, the water tracks, will overflow soon  
So take the wind, rise and begin, follow it over  

And did you know, that summer growth, is waiting for you  
To a special some, the time has come, to start the new year  
And nothing can, change the past, you've always been here  
And did you know, that summer growth, is waiting for you  

The medicine, causes bad dreams, but at least they're not real  
But then again, the same is said, about what you're hearing  
A voice is sent, from a cruel friend, your brain is bleeding  
The medicine, causes bad dreams, but at least they're not real  

You're a dancer that, is spinning fast, sick of the rhythm  
And the people's cheers, fall on deaf ears, and soon go quiet  
But you're moving now, can't be held down, by their silence  
You're a dancer that, is spinning fast, sick of the rhythm  

And nothing comes to you, anymore  
And nothing comes to you, anymore  
And nothing comes to you, anymore, my poor friend
