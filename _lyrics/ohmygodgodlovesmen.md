## Oh My God, God Loves Men
God, he’s gay for Jesus  
He nailed him to a cross  
God, he’s gay for Jesus  
And he’s violent to get off  

God, he’s gay for Jesus  
He wore that crown of thorns  
God, he’s gay for Jesus  
Queer as a unicorn  

Scantily clad, he went off and died for you  
Covered in sand, his body is aching for you  
And he said to God, why have you forsaken me  
And God said to he, why don’t you just shake it for me  

God, he’s gay for Jesus  
He went off to die for your sins  
God, he’s gay for Jesus  
And he wants him in bed, naked  

God, he’s gay for Jesus  
This part, it is the worst  
God, he’s gay for Jesus  
Tag teamed by the holy ghost  

Yahweh, yahweh, you’re gay  
Yahweh, yahweh, you’re gay  
Yahweh, yahweh, you’re gay  
Yahweh, yahweh, you’re gay, you're gay, you’re gay, you’re gay  
God, he’s gay for Jesus  
He nailed him to a cross  
God, he’s gay for Jesus  
And he’s violent to get off
