title: Honeyed Hotel
---

The World stopped spinning years ago in the spirit of barbed wire  
And sleepy eyes rest on the horizon  
And if you'd told me there's no future left for us right here  
I'd have said my poor friend just let it go, let it go  
So fill the world with love, kill the earth with time  
Don't tell me how it ends, just let it go, let it go  
And when we wake up in the morning we won't know where to go from here  
So let it go, let it go now  

Let it go, let it go now  
Let it go, let it go now  
Let it go, the world is fucked now  

And isn't that what we've been told, don't waste it all, don't live for more  
Choose to ignore our painted youth  
Someone's coming up the hill, without spirit and without will  
It's just another mind for me to abuse  
Industry, it's in our streets  
And isn't that what we've been told, don't waste it all, don't live for more  
Have you seen, blue moons rising  
Isn't that what we've been told, don't waste it all, don't live for more  

Don't waste it all, don't live for more  
Don't waste it all, don't live for more  
Don't waste it all don't live for more, no  

Promised rest, but go no sleep  
In this white-hot summer heat  
And street lights in parking lots  
Can't seem to stay on  
So lay with me for a little while  
Walk into the sun  
And we'll learn why the hills have been  
Indifferent towards us  

Meet me at the honeyed hotel  
Where the walls are bone and skull dry  
Where the rooms have cracked and bleached white  
Where you'll find me strange again  

It's where you'll find me strange again  
It's where you'll find me strange again  

The World stopped spinning years ago in the spirit of barbed wire  
And sleepy eyes rest on the horizons
