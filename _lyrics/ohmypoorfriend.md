## Oh, My Poor Friend
Oh, my poor friend did they  
take it away did they  
try to say that  
nothing changes when you  
take the trip and when you  
swallowed the pearl  
a suicide for a poor writer but your  
feet now on the world  

Oh, my poor friend did they  
lie and did they steal did they  
say such sweet things about  
what you'd feel but your  
mind has left you like a  
handful of sand and the  
dark world calls out for you to  
take its hand  

Oh, my poor friend did they  
send you to god did they  
bring you a higher message  
through the music you have lost  
and they swear you have it still  
but god damn them if they're right lost like a  
spark in the fire lost like a  
bird in the night  

Oh, my poor friend I'm afraid your  
number has been drawn  
I'm afraid of what you'll find when  
you're left all alone and I  
know it's too strange I know  
The beauty of it all  
Framed and placed in a bitter space  
Like those portraits on the walls  

Oh my poor friend it's getting  
harder to see in the  
shadows of your creations  
in your sins and your misdeeds  
Oh my poor friend when is it  
time to rest your head  
when is your single chance at peace again  
when is your cue to move ahead  

Oh, my poor friend you're getting  
sicker by the day
