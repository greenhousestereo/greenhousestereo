## New Woman
You said you'd bring me to the brink of the world  
With just one drink from your ancient pearl  
And though we're sleeping now, still I'll wonder how, it got peaceful  

You said winter will bring you no luck  
It will drag you away from the high August sun  
But don't try to look around, for some higher ground, to hold onto  

Our dreams they transport us  
To a place where trains have ground to dust  
Cool air on ocean's green, and things I've never seen, but I want to  

And would it help you to be wide awake  
So that a lover's a stranger for the stranger's sake  
Can't tell them how to be, they aren't a part of me, and they've never been  

Our hands now they're starting to fold  
So we're running the facets until the water grows cold  
And searching for a way to make this new again  
And we're getting higher  
Getting higher  
Getting higher, yeah
