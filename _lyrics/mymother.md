title: My Mother
---

My mother calls six times a day
Asking me to come home
And I'm afraid of what I might say
Just to keep her alone
â€˜Cause there's blood in my shoes, there's salt in my heart
And ideas in me
And I know that to keep her close
I'll have to keep her from me

My mother calls with the sleep in her face
Asking where will I go
And I keep telling her what I think is safe
Just to keep her alone
I had a vision of a woman at arms
Who would change this poor world
But if I want her to see what she used to see
It's best to keep her at home
