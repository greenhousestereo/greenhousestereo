Such a sweet face welcome to the surface  
But we know you won't get any further  
So you sit and drink your cheap wine  
Don’t I know you're an expert  

Honeysuckle grows close to here  
But we know that’s not what you need  
You want the world to know who you are  
Why should you be so lucky  

And if you could choose would you choose right here  
Or would you still pull at your sleeves  
I think i'd like to have to just one thing  
Cause what’s the end of life but daylights peace  

Come on bring on the sun  
Come on bring on the sun  
Come on Kings of Religion  

And you know the world has stopped growing  
And there's less and less every day  
And I've been watching your faint eyes dull  
So I know you have your options weighed  

So I ask where you’re going  
And where you’ve been before here  
And would you like to see where I sleep  
And could you just answer me  

And so we’re staring at the ceiling  
And we wonder how we get up there  
And though it's not far up there  
It’s at least so far from here  

Come on bring on the sun  
Come on bring on the sun  
Come on Kings of Religion
