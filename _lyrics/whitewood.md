## Whitewood
Onward to Whitewood, we're finding nothing new under the darkened snow  
And so we wonder, who were the last ones with their drunken notions misunderstood  
Turn and face the ceiling. Search the patterns for new faces, it's a goddamn distraction  
Such a familiar feeling. The wintry madness of a devil's tongue won't leave you home  

Sleeping in, sleeping in now  
Find a friend, yeah find a friend now  
Sleeping in, sleeping in now  
Fuck a friend, yeah fuck a friend now
