title: Lying Still
---

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls  
It's time we set aside our spoils  
And clear our poor, sad eyes of poison  

Men-like gods and god-like men  
Spend their lives within a whisper  
Try not to wake from their child-like boredom  

Live our lives, living dormant  
Oblivious to what we'd forfeit  
Not to know the minds of our poor soldier  

I'm yours now  
Not to think it's not to breathe  
We're shallow  
Are we just lying still  

Unworthy  
Not to dream it's not to sleep  
You bore me  
Are we just lying still  

The same thing  
Generation of Coping  
Still waiting  
Are we just lying still  
Are we just lying still
