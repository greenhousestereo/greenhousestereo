## Mayday
Touch me this and touch me there  
Train my tastes and train my fears  
Set the rules, make an exception  
And pass me through your disinterest  

I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter  
I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter  

Come down, breathe some life into my bones  
But leave me dreams alone, they're all soaked  
Pity me and I'll pity you  
Steal my sleep, my gift to you  

I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter  
I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter  

Mayday, mayday, having a problem with you  
Would you, would you have a problem with something new
