## Mayday
Touch me this and touch me there
Train my tastes and train my fears
Set the rules, make an exception
And pass me through your disinterest

I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter
I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter

Come down, breathe some life into my bones
But leave me dreams alone, they're all soaked
Pity me and I'll pity you
Steal my sleep, my gift to you

I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter
I'll follow you wherever. I'll follow you no matter

Mayday, mayday, having a problem with you
Would you, would you have a problem with something new
