## Savage
Come on brothers, let's break out, she asked  
Where ya gonna be, a year from now, it's getting  
Harder and harder to tell, fact from  
Figment though we know it so well  
And winter rests deep in prairie eyes, ride the  
Roaring wind through sandstone hills  
Now is the time, to fear for your soul  
Now's the time to fear for me  
  
And it's a savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  

Grab the evening, let its silence pour  
Our mothers lie in our wake  
And if it's easy to fix this past of pretend  
I'll see you when ya come back in  

And it's a savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  

Your mind now's a distant memory  
And the faces we tried to hide  
Are starting to get their best of me  
Think of when we thought the world had died  

Leave your lilies in your garden  
In the oceans of red, red dust and clay  
And dream of when all this had started  
In the oceans of red, red dust and clay  

And it's a savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
And it's a savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday  
Savage, savage ugly Sunday
