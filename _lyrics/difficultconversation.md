title: Difficult Conversation
---

Listen friend, I know it’s hard to hear  
But there’s something I need to say  
You’ve fallen far my friend  
Though you’ve not squandered it  
I hate to see you like this  
You’ve got to get up, get right, get on with your life  
It don’t have to be this way  
Maybe I can help you friend, pull you out of this  
You know you can start again  

Sometimes I feel like I can’t get away  
Like I’m stuck in the same routine  
I can’t figure out, how to talk about it  
Without feeling as though somehow I’ve failed  

You’ve got a lot to live for, a lot to give  
I know it’s hard to see  
I believe in you my friend, please find yourself  
And I know you’ll be happy again  

Maybe I’m scared, been living this way for so damn long  
You know I think you’re right, I need to change my life  
I am not satisfied anymore, but  
I’m not ready
