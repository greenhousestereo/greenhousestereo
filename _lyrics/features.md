## Features
You thought you knew your features well  
You thought you knew every inch of yourself  
Until you saw your face, that glass image, and you remembered once again  
A soundless home, a distance grown, an understanding that you're wrong  
And you feel it, well sure you do  

You tried to call that number then  
You lost your chance with the smearing of a pen  
So your thoughts have strayed, your colors fade, and weakness is forever made  
You've left your home, you're all alone, now you're standing in some madman's clothes  
And you feel it, well sure you do  

And he said  
You will pay for everything you've done  
You will pay no matter where you go  
And now you find, sickness in crime, you've lost your only sense of time  
A twisted tongue, itâ€™s a restless song, the forest aches now every dawn  
And you feel it, please say you do  

He said I am now alive again, again  
He said I will never be your friend, your friend  
He said I am that on which you depend, depend  
He said I will be duplicity foreign  
He said I will be duplicity foreign  
He said I will be duplicity foreign  
He said I will be duplicity foreign
