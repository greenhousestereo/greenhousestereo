## It's Gone Away
Could you find me?  
Could you find me in all your old home movies?  
You’re gonna face  
My disgrace  

Who are you now  
Who are you now who you fret still avowed  
It’s a new place  
You must embrace  

Coming from times  
Coming from times all along tattered lines  
You’d have to say  
A lot has changed  

Indifferent to me all these crisp memories  
Staring out blank in the sun  
Running around this old stationed town  
There’s no news here as of late  
You’ll have to wait  

Who are you now  
Who are you now who you fret still avowed  
It’s a new place  
You must embrace  

Indifferent to me all these crisp memories  
Staring out blank in the sun  
Running around this old stationed town  
There’s no news here as you say  
It’s gone away  
It’s gone away  
It’s gone away
