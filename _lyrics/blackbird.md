It's true what you've heard and now suspect  
But leaving just won't ease a regretful past  
And I really hope to see you once again  
And I really hope to see you once again  

Yeah

God tricked the world with his colors  
Now you say you've left to go and find another  
Did you really think this world would change for you  
Did you really think this world would change for you  

And god is just a number on the wall  
And god is just a number on the wall  

The black birds all burn on their feeders  
Pull your fingers out my mouth they're tasting bitter  
And I don't think I can stand the sight of you  
No I don't think I can stand the sight of you  

And god is just as jealous as us all  
And god is just as jealous as us all  

We got stuck inside the attic; the music plays  
And you laid down in front of me to open your legs  
Can't stop staring at the spot where your clothes lay  
Can't stop staring at the spot where your clothes lay  

Where they lay  
Where they lay  
Where they lay  
Where they lay
