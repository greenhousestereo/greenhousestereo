title: Open Eyes
---

It hasn’t really snowed down here  
At least not much lately  
So I’ll spend some time on those frosted peaks  
It’s getting kind of cloudy though  
My future and me  
Will look back with fond memories  

And though the ocean’s always moving  
It’s locked in spots  
Wonder if it’d really like to break free  
And for what cost  

It looks like such a lovely place  
In pics and TV  
I’d like to go sometime  
If you’d come with me  

I know it’s probably not too healthy  
To speak to rocks  
Maybe if one replies to me  
We’ll have deep talks  

What a fantastic feeling  
I’d like it to stay  
Entertaining endeavors  
Wasting the days  
It feels so right  
When I open my eyes  

Find myself inside a crowd  
These people I meet  
Can’t quite tell if they’re friends  
Or just friendly  
I’ll have a drink, and sing a song  
Meander back home  
I’m safe with my clan  
Life’s good, I suppose  
  
I know I should probably stop complaining  
I’ll never starve  
I’ve done my fair share of waiting  
Now’s time to start  

Uncomfortable feelings  
I must ascertain  
Did you think you gave me much reason to stay?  
Didn’t feel quite right  
So I opened my eyes  
  
What a wonderful feeling  
I had just today  
Overwhelming ambition  
On every word I fixate  
It feels so right  
So I open my eyes
