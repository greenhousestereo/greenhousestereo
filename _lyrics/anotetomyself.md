## A Note to Myself
Don't even act like you never knew  
Voice in the mirror it was nothing new  
Everyone's past comes back on you  
And you gotta get high to find some room  
You have to  
You have to be  
You have to be pure poetry  

Don't you know some things shouldn't exist  
Mosquitoes in the air, not a lick of difference  
Always in the reach of your sipless poison  
All I want now is a stop of events  

You asked to  
You asked to be  
You asked to be pure poetry  

Don't blame me for your luckless form  
Stuck with a gut of rotted sea foam  
Why haven't you prepared for the sunlight snow  
Time’s coming fast, it keeps wanting more  

You have to  
You have to be  
You have to be pure jealousy
