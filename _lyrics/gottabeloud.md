## Gotta Be Loud
I've gone far above my call to sin  
Been sitting languid tired and content  
My voice has gotten thin  
Cause you gotta be loud if you wanna blend in  

I've got a pistol sitting on my brain  
Unload reload and clean it out again  
I'll go visit friends  
Just so I can feel alive again  

I've been drinking down the bath for days  
Gonna hang the picture once I find the frame  
Just want to be awake  
Cause sleep isn't easy when everyone knows that you're fake  

You can't walk backwards, but you can loop around  
The hand keeps moving, and it just won't slow down  
They only love you later on  
But for now you'll have to pretend that you're wrong
