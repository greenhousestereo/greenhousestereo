title: A Penny Saved
---

A penny saved is a woman fired  
‘Cause at work, all they do is cry  
And bitch and moan about equality  
Until you find them talking and gossiping  
In the backroom where no one’s supposed to go  

Separate the sports and separate the games    
They need a handicap in everything we play  
Soccer and football, mother fucking gym  
Nothing’s equal playing fair with them  
You’ll soon find them asking for an exception  

Police stations and the army, too  
Do you feel safe with them protecting you  
‘Cause under pressure, all women crack  
Yet they tag along in the war in Iraq  
No man should die for a woman’s mistake  

Having kids their specialty  
But raise them alone, and you’ll soon see  
Not all their kids fill our prisons  
But seventy percent, well, it’s a shocking figure  
Single mothers, responsible for crooks  

Working and thinking, it’s what men do  
So what’s left for a woman to do  
But cook and clean, wash the glass  
Or sit at home on their ass  
And still they’ll bitch about how hard it can be  

This is the truth, although it may sound harsh  
Pregnancy, it’s always their fault  
When everything’s fine, they’ll take responsibility  
And they have no problem laying claims to their bodies  
But when the bills stack up, they’re willing to sell some stock  

It’s a metaphor  
It means they’re whores
