title: Time

Push the door fairly gently forward  
See the wicked white portraits  
Cracking on the weathered, old floor  
Let me ask you, was it worth it  
It's getting hard to look  
A stranger in the eyes  
And does your mother know your name anymore  
Now that you know you're divine  
    
We're sharing our stories of bled  
Since it seems so relevant now  
And you sit with your empty head  
Filled with ideas  
Filling up with time  
    
Didn't take much time to notice  
World was jarred out of place  
Have to ask whether I'm sober  
From a spectre in the sheets, in the sheets  
    
Nothing really matters  
If it's not left in your mind  
And you sit with your empty head  
Filled with ideas  
Filling up with time  
    
It's getting hard to stand  
Up for your own ideals  
And you sit with your empty head  
Filled with ideas  
Filling up with time
