title: Time

Push the door fairly gently forward
See the wicked white portraits
Cracking on the weathered, old floor
Let me ask you, was it worth it
It's getting hard to look
A stranger in the eyes
And does your mother know your name anymore
Now that you know you're divine

We're sharing our stories of bled
Since it seems so relevant now
And you sit with your empty head
Filled with ideas
Filling up with time

Didn't take much time to notice
World was jarred out of place
Have to ask whether I'm sober
From a spectre in the sheets, in the sheets

Nothing really matters
If it's not left in your mind
And you sit with your empty head
Filled with ideas
Filling up with time

It's getting hard to stand
Up for your own ideals
And you sit with your empty head
Filled with ideas
Filling up with time
