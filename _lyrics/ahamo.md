## Ahamo
Who owns these lonely roads  
Sides streets of Ahamo  
Wanders with no fool above  
Who owns these lonely roads  

Loving paleness  
Empty promise  
Comforting madness, yeah  

Doors unlocked in alleyways  
And we will never be the same, no  
Walk until the break of day  
Doors unlocked in alleyways  

Sunday morning  
Runs from Evening  
Mama, I'm leaving you  

Voodoo lovers lie  
On this dead dog world of mine  
Run now, can't catch the ground  
On this dead dog world of mine  

*Dustin Grey*
